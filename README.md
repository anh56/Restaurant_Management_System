	Topic B: Restaurant Management System
	Steve wants to open a new restaurant with full using of technologies and as few human labors as possible. On each table, there is a computer with a touching screen. After entering the restaurant, customers find an empty table, start browsing the menu, select their favor foods and then order their meal of several courses. Their order will be transmitted to the computer of the cook in the kitchen. Because of several orders can come to the cook in a time, the cook has to plan his cooking schedule. After receiving an order, depending on his schedule, he enters the time the course will be prepared and ready to use. This time will be reported back to customers. After the cook finish a course, he will send to a delivery system to transport it to the customer’s table.When the customers finish their meal, they send a signal to the casher over the system. The casher send a bill, in which the cost is based on what customers have been ordered and used, will be sent back to customers. They will fill in their debit card information to pay the bill. The system checks the filled information, finishes the payment process and send to thankful message to the customers. The customers happily leave the restaurant without talking to anyone. The restaurant manager has to manage the menu. Every time, there is any change (a course appears, an old course is removed, the price of a course is changed…), he use the system to make that change in the morning before the restaurant is opened.Customers will be very happy with the system because they do not need to wait waiters to order any meal. They can order what they like whenever they want. After ordering their foods, they can know when their food is ready. They can enjoy their meal in their place without being interfered by anyone.
